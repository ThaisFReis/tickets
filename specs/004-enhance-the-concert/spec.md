# Feature Specification: Assigned Seating for Concert Tickets

**Feature Branch**: `004-enhance-the-concert`
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a ticket buyer, I want to select a specific seat from an interactive venue map when purchasing a ticket for a concert, so that I can choose my preferred seating location.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a concert event with assigned seating, **When** I view the event details page, **Then** I should see an interactive venue map with sections, rows, and seats.
2.  **Given** the interactive venue map is displayed, **When** I click on an available seat, **Then** the seat should be marked as selected and added to my cart.
3.  **Given** I have a seat selected, **When** I click on the same seat again, **Then** the seat should be de-selected and removed from my cart.
4.  **Given** I have selected a seat and another user purchases it before I complete my transaction, **When** I try to purchase the seat, **Then** the transaction should fail and I should be notified that the seat is no longer available.
5.  **Given** I have successfully purchased a ticket for a specific seat, **When** I view my ticket NFT, **Then** it should contain the correct metadata for the section, row, and seat number.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user tries to select more seats than allowed in a single transaction? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum number of seats per transaction not specified]
- How does the system handle venue maps for different types of venues (e.g., amphitheater vs. arena)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Venue map creation and management process not specified]
