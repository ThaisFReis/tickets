# Implementation Plan: Decentralized Concert Ticket Marketplace

**Branch**: `003-build-a-decentralized` | **Date**: 2025-09-08 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-build-a-decentralized/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a decentralized concert ticket marketplace. The frontend will be a React application, and the backend will be a Solidity smart contract. Users will interact with the dApp using their crypto wallets.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Solidity ^0.8.20, Node.js (latest LTS), React (latest)
**Primary Dependencies**: Hardhat, Ethers.js, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Ethereum blockchain (for contract state)
**Testing**: Hardhat (for contract tests), Vitest (for frontend tests)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers with wallet extensions
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific performance goals for transaction speed and UI responsiveness]
**Constraints**: The core logic must be decentralized and run on the blockchain.
**Scale/Scope**: A proof-of-concept dApp with the core features defined in the spec.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (dApp structure)
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes, as per TDD strategy
- Git commits show tests before implementation? This will be enforced during development.
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes, Hardhat node for local development.
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Logging strategy for frontend and backend]
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Will be a focus during development.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A for this project structure.
- Breaking changes handled? N/A for initial version.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract function → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → frontend component and integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Backend first: Smart contract development and testing, then frontend.
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |
