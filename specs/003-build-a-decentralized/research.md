# Research & Decisions

## Technology Stack Selection

- **Decision**:
  - **Frontend**: React with Vite and Tailwind CSS
  - **Backend (Smart Contract)**: Solidity with Hardhat
  - **Integration**: Ethers.js
- **Rationale**: The user explicitly defined this stack. It's a modern and widely-used combination for dApp development.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the stack was specified.

## Project Structure

- **Decision**: A monorepo with `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- **Rationale**: This structure cleanly separates the frontend and backend concerns, which is ideal for this project.
- **Alternatives considered**: A single repository, but the monorepo structure is better for this dApp.

## Testing Strategy

- **Decision**:
  - **Smart Contract**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Hardhat's testing environment.
  - **Frontend**: Vitest for component and integration testing.
- **Rationale**: TDD is a constitutional requirement. Hardhat and Vitest are the standard testing tools for their respective stacks.
- **Alternatives considered**: None.
