# Feature Specification: Decentralized Concert Ticket Marketplace

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-decentralized`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a decentralized application (dApp) for a concert ticket marketplace where tickets are NFTs. Identity is managed by connecting a crypto wallet, not with traditional logins. The core logic must be in a smart contract. Key features: 1. **Event & Ticket Logic (Smart Contract):** - The smart contract must manage all events and enforce rules preventing the sale of tickets for past or sold-out shows. - The purchase action must be an on-chain transaction that mints a ticket NFT and transfers it to the buyer's wallet. 2. **Frontend Interface (UI):** - The main page must display available concerts by reading data from the smart contract. - Users must be able to filter and sort concerts by date, category (e.g., Rock, Pop), and price. 3. **User Profile (Wallet-Based):** - A user's profile is directly associated with their connected wallet address. - The profile must display the ticket NFTs owned by that wallet, separating them into 'Upcoming' and 'Past' events based on the metadata on the NFT."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a concert-goer, I want to browse upcoming concerts, purchase tickets as NFTs using my crypto wallet, and see the tickets I own in a personal profile, so I can securely manage my attendance at live events.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has connected their crypto wallet, **When** they view the main page, **Then** they see a list of available concerts.
2. **Given** a user is viewing the list of concerts, **When** they apply a filter for "Rock" music, **Then** the list updates to show only rock concerts.
3. **Given** a user has selected a concert and initiated a purchase, **When** the on-chain transaction is successful, **Then** a ticket NFT is minted and transferred to their wallet.
4. **Given** a user navigates to their profile, **When** their wallet owns ticket NFTs, **Then** they see their tickets separated into "Upcoming" and "Past" events.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to purchase a ticket for a sold-out concert?
- How does the system handle a user trying to buy a ticket for a concert that is in the past?
- What is displayed on the user profile if they have no ticket NFTs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST use a crypto wallet for user identity and authentication.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST represent concert tickets as NFTs.
- **FR-003**: The system's core logic for events and tickets MUST be managed by a smart contract.
- **FR-004**: The smart contract MUST prevent the sale of tickets for past or sold-out events.
- **FR-005**: The act of purchasing a ticket MUST be an on-chain transaction that mints and transfers a ticket NFT.
- **FR-006**: The main page MUST display available concerts by reading data from the smart contract.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to filter concerts by date, category, and price.
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to sort concerts by date, category, and price.
- **FR-009**: A user's profile MUST be associated with their connected wallet address.
- **FR-010**: The user profile MUST display ticket NFTs owned by the wallet.
- **FR-011**: The user profile MUST categorize owned tickets into "Upcoming" and "Past" based on NFT metadata.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide clear feedback to the user if a ticket purchase fails. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific failure scenarios and corresponding user messages?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Concert Event**: Represents a single concert with attributes like date, category, price, and ticket availability.
- **Ticket NFT**: Represents a unique ticket for a concert, owned by a user's wallet. Contains metadata linking it to a specific event and indicating if it's for an upcoming or past event.
- **User Profile**: Represents the user's view of their assets, identified by their wallet address and displaying their owned Ticket NFTs.
