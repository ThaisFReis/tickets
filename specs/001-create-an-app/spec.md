# Feature Specification: Concert Ticket Purchasing App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-app`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an app that allows you to buy concert tickets. Users can only buy tickets for shows that aren't sold out and for shows that aren't older than the current date. Shows can be filtered and organized by date, category, and price. Users must have a profile, which contains their information and both used and new tickets."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to find and purchase tickets for upcoming concerts so that I can attend live music events. I also want to be able to view my purchased tickets in my profile.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the concert list page, **When** they filter by "Rock" category, **Then** only concerts in the "Rock" category are displayed.
2. **Given** a user is viewing a concert that is not sold out and is in the future, **When** they click the "Buy Ticket" button, **Then** they are taken to a purchase confirmation page.
3. **Given** a user has purchased a ticket, **When** they view their profile, **Then** the new ticket is visible in their list of tickets.
4. **Given** a user is viewing a concert that is sold out, **When** they view the concert details, **Then** the "Buy Ticket" button is disabled.
5. **Given** a user is viewing a concert that has already passed, **When** they try to view the concert, **Then** the concert is not shown in the list of available concerts.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to buy the last available ticket at the same time as another user?
- How does the system handle payment failures?
- What happens if a user loses internet connection during the purchase process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and manage a profile with their personal information.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of concerts with filtering and sorting options for date, category, and price.
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent users from purchasing tickets for sold-out or past concerts.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to purchase tickets for available concerts.
- **FR-005**: System MUST store and display a user's purchased tickets (both new and used) in their profile.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a mechanism for users to log in and out of their accounts. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
