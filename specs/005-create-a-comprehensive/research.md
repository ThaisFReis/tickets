# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Decentralized Concert Ticket Marketplace
**Date**: 2025-09-08

This document outlines the technical decisions made for the dApp, based on the feature specification and user-provided constraints.

## 1. Backend Technology

-   **Decision**: Hardhat will be used for the smart contract development environment. Solidity will be the language for the smart contract.
-   **Rationale**: Hardhat is a standard and robust tool for Ethereum development, providing a comprehensive environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Solidity is the primary language for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Truffle (another popular development framework, but Hardhat is generally considered more modern and flexible).

## 2. Frontend Technology

-   **Decision**: The frontend will be built using React with Vite. Styling will be handled by Tailwind CSS.
-   **Rationale**: React is a widely-adopted and powerful library for building user interfaces. Vite provides a fast and modern development experience with near-instant hot module replacement. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and consistent UI development.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Vue.js, Angular (React has a larger ecosystem and is a common choice for dApp development).

## 3. Blockchain Interaction

-   **Decision**: Ethers.js will be used for all communication between the frontend and the smart contract.
-   **Rationale**: Ethers.js is a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. It is a well-maintained and widely-used standard.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Web3.js (Ethers.js is generally preferred for its smaller size, cleaner API, and better documentation).

## 4. Architecture

-   **Decision**: The project will be structured as a monorepo with `frontend` and `backend` packages. Venue map layout data will be stored off-chain as JSON files.
-   **Rationale**: A monorepo structure simplifies dependency management and cross-package development. Storing venue map data off-chain is crucial for optimizing gas costs, as storing large data structures on the blockchain is prohibitively expensive. The frontend will fetch this JSON data to render the interactive maps.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Storing venue data on-chain (rejected due to high gas costs).

## 5. Testing Strategy

-   **Decision**: A strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology will be enforced for both backend (Solidity) and frontend (React) development.
-   **Rationale**: TDD ensures that the code is written to meet specific, testable requirements. This leads to higher code quality, better test coverage, and more maintainable software. For smart contracts, where bugs can have significant financial consequences, a rigorous testing approach is non-negotiable.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: Writing tests after implementation (rejected as it does not align with best practices for mission-critical software).
