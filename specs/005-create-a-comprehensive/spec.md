# Feature Specification: Decentralized Concert Ticket Marketplace

**Feature Branch**: `005-create-a-comprehensive`
**Created**: 2025-09-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive specification for a decentralized concert ticket marketplace dApp. The system's identity management must be based on connecting a crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). All tickets must be minted as NFTs on the blockchain to ensure verifiable ownership. The dApp must support two distinct event types: 1. **General Admission Events:** Tickets grant general entry without a specific seat. The smart contract only needs to track the number of tickets sold against the total available. 2. **Assigned Seating Events:** Tickets correspond to a unique seat (e.g., Section A, Row 5, Seat 12). For these events, the UI must display an interactive venue map where users can visually select available seats. The smart contract is the single source of truth and must enforce all business logic: - Prevent the sale of tickets for events that are in the past or sold out. - For assigned seating, prevent the double-booking of any individual seat. - Ticket prices should be defined per event. The user profile page should be tied to the user's wallet address and display all owned ticket NFTs, clearly separating them into "Upcoming" and "Past" events."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a concert-goer, I want to connect my crypto wallet to a decentralized marketplace to securely purchase concert tickets as NFTs. I want to be able to buy tickets for both general admission and assigned seating events, and easily view all my upcoming and past event tickets in a personal profile tied to my wallet.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I have a crypto wallet, **When** I visit the dApp, **Then** I can connect my wallet to authenticate.
2.  **Given** I am viewing a general admission event with available tickets, **When** I purchase a ticket, **Then** an NFT ticket is minted to my wallet and the event's ticket count is updated.
3.  **Given** I am viewing an assigned seating event with an interactive map, **When** I select an available seat and purchase a ticket, **Then** an NFT ticket for that specific seat is minted to my wallet and the seat becomes unavailable.
4.  **Given** I have purchased tickets, **When** I navigate to my user profile, **Then** I can see a list of my ticket NFTs, separated into "Upcoming" and "Past" events based on the event date.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens when a user tries to purchase a ticket for an event that is sold out? The transaction should fail with a "Sold Out" message.
-   What happens when a user tries to purchase a ticket for an event whose date has already passed? The transaction should fail with an "Event has passed" message.
-   What happens when two users try to purchase the same assigned seat simultaneously? The first transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain should succeed, and the second should fail.
-   What happens if a user's payment is insufficient for the ticket price? The transaction should fail with an "Insufficient Payment" message.
