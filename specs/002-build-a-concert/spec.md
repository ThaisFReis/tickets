# Feature Specification: Concert Ticket Marketplace App

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-concert`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a concert ticket marketplace app. **1. User Authentication & Profile:** - Users can sign up and log in using email/password and also via Google Sign-In. - The user profile must contain: user's full name, a profile picture, and two sections for tickets: "Upcoming" and "Past". - Each ticket in the profile should be displayed as a card with the event name, date, and location. Clicking the card reveals a QR code for entry. **2. Event Listings & Discovery:** - The main screen shows a list of available concerts with a large image, event name, date, and starting price. - Users can filter the list by: - Date (e.g., "This Weekend", "Next Month") - Category (e.g., "Rock", "Pop", "Samba") - Price Range (using a slider). - Users can also sort the filtered results by date (newest first) or price (lowest first). - A search bar allows users to find events by artist or venue name. - Events that are sold out or have already passed should not appear in the main list. **3. Purchasing Flow:** - On an event's detail page, users can see a full description, venue map, and available ticket types (e.g., "General Admission", "VIP"). - Users select the ticket type and quantity. - The checkout process is simulated: after confirming the selection, the tickets are instantly "purchased" and added to the user's profile under the "Upcoming" section. No real payment will be processed. - A confirmation message should be displayed on the screen after the purchase is complete."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to easily find, purchase, and manage my concert tickets so I can have a seamless experience from discovery to event entry.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign up with their email and password, **Then** they are logged in and a user profile is created.
2. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they navigate to the main screen, **Then** they see a list of available concerts.
3. **Given** a user is on the main screen, **When** they use the search bar to find "The Strokes", **Then** the list updates to show only concerts by "The Strokes".
4. **Given** a user is viewing the concert list, **When** they filter by "Rock" and sort by "Price (lowest first)", **Then** the list shows the cheapest rock concerts first.
5. **Given** a user selects a concert, **When** they choose 2 "VIP" tickets and click "Confirm Purchase", **Then** a confirmation message appears and the tickets are added to their profile's "Upcoming" section.
6. **Given** a user is in their profile, **When** they click on an upcoming ticket, **Then** a QR code is displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user's Google Sign-In email is already associated with an email/password account?
- How does the system handle a user trying to purchase more tickets than are available for a specific type?
- What is displayed if a user has no upcoming or past tickets in their profile?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to sign up and log in with email/password and Google Sign-In.
- **FR-002**: User profiles MUST contain full name, profile picture, and separate "Upcoming" and "Past" ticket sections.
- **FR-003**: Each ticket in the profile MUST be a card showing event name, date, location, and a clickable QR code.
- **FR-004**: The main screen MUST display a list of available concerts with an image, name, date, and starting price.
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT show sold-out or past events in the main discovery list.
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to filter concerts by date range, category, and price range (slider).
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to sort filtered results by date (newest first) or price (lowest first).
